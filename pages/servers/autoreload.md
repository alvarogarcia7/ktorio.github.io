During development it is important to have fast feedback loop cycle. 
Often, restarting server would take quite some time, so Ktor provides basic auto-reload facility that
reloads just an Application.

**Performance Note:** There is a performance penalty when using autoreloading. So keep in mind that you shouldn't use
it on production or when doing benchmarks.

## Basics

Either when using embeddedServer or a configuration file, you will have to provide a list of watch substrings
that should match the classloaders you want to watch.

So for example, a typical example of class loader when using gradle could be:
`/Users/user/projects/ktor-exercises/solutions/exercise4/build/classes/kotlin/main`

In this case you can use the `solutions/exercise4` string when watching, so it will match that classloader.

## Using embeddedServer

When using a custom main using `embeddedServer`, you can use the default parameter `watchPaths` to provide
a list of subpaths that will be watched and reloaded.

`fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(
        Netty,
        watchPaths = listOf("solutions/exercise4"),
        port = 8080,
        module = Application::mymodule
    ).apply { start(wait = true) 
}`

Note that here you shouldn't use a lambda to configure the server, but to provide a method reference to your
Application module.

```
fun Application.mymodule() {
    routing {
        get("/plain") {
            call.respondText("Hello World!")
        }
    }
}
```

If yoy try to use a lambda instead of a method reference, you will get the following error:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Module function provided as lambda cannot be unlinked for reload
```

To fix this error, you just have to extract your lambda body to an Application extension method (module) just like this:

Code that **won't** work:
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, watchPaths = listOf("solutions/exercise4"), port = 8080) { // ERROR! Module function provided as lambda cannot be unlinked for reload
        routing {
            get("/") {
                call.respondText("Hello World!")
            }
        }
    }.start(true)
}
```

Code that will work:
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, watchPaths = listOf("solutions/exercise4"), port = 8080, module = Application::mymodule).start(true) // GOOD!, it will work
}

fun Application.mymodule() {
    routing {
        get("/") {
            call.respondText("Hello World!")
        }
    }
}
```

<a id="configuration-file"></a>
## Using configuration file

When using a configuration file, for example with a [`DevelopmentEngine`](/servers/engine.html) to either run
from the command line or hosted within another server: 

To enable this feature, add `watch` keys to `ktor.deployment` configuration. 

`watch` - Array of class path entries that should be watched and automatically reloaded.

```
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
        watch = [ module1, module2 ]
    }
    
    â€¦
}
```

For now watch keys are just strings that are matched with `contains` against classpath entries of the loaded 
application, such as a jar name or a project directory name. 
These classes are then loaded with special `ClassLoader` that is recycled when change is detected.

**Note:** `ktor-server-core` classes are specifically excluded from auto-reloading, so if you are working on something in ktor itself, 
don't expect it to be reload automatically. It can't work because core classes are loaded before auto-reload machinery kicks in. 
The exclusion can potentially be smaller, but it's hard to analyse all the transitive closure of types loaded during
startup.

## Example

Consider the following example:

You can run the application by either a `build.gradle` or directly within your IDE.
Executing the main method in the example file, or by executing : `io.ktor.server.netty.DevelopmentEngine.main`.
DevelopmentEngine by using `commandLineEnvironment` will be in charge of loading the `application.conf` file (that is in HOCON format).

`Main.kt`:
```kotlin
package io.ktor.exercise.autoreload

import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.http.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.*
import io.ktor.server.netty.*

// Exposed as: `static void io.ktor.exercise.autoreload.MainKt.main(String[] args)`
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    //io.ktor.server.netty.main(args) // Manually using Netty's DevelopmentEngine
    embeddedServer(Netty, watchPaths = listOf("solutions/exercise4"), port = 8080, module = Application::module).apply { start(wait = true) 
}

// Exposed as: `static void io.ktor.exercise.autoreload.MainKt.module(Application receiver)`
fun Application.module() {
    routing {
        get("/plain") {
            call.respondText("Hello World!")
        }
    }
}
```

`application.conf`:
```kotlin
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
        watch = [ solutions/exercise4 ]
    }

    application {
        modules = [ io.ktor.exercise.autoreload.MainKt.module ]
    }
}
```

As you can see, you specify a list of strings to match the classloaders you want to watch (in this case just `solutions/exercise4`),
that should be reloaded upon modification.

## Recompiling automatically on source changes

Since Autoreload feature just detect changes on class files, you have to compile the application by yourself.
You can do it using intelliJ IDEA with `Build -> Build Project` while running.

But you can also use gradle to automatically detect source changes and compile it for you. So you can just open
other terminal in your project folder and run: `gradle -t build`. It will compile the application, and after doing so
it will be listening for additional source changes and recompiling when necessary.

You can then use other terminal to run the application with `gradle run`.
