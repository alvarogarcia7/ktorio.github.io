During development it is important to have fast feedback loop cycle.
Often, restarting server would take quite some time, so Ktor provides basic auto-reload facility that
reloads just an Application. To enable this feature, add `watch` keys to `ktor.deployment`
configuration.

`watch` - Array of class path entries that should be watched and automatically reloaded.

```kotlin
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
        watch = [ module1, module2 ]
    }

    â€¦
}
```

For now watch keys are just strings that are matched with `contains` against classpath entries of the loaded
application, such as a jar name or a project directory name.
These classes are then loaded with special `ClassLoader` that is recycled when change is detected.

_Note:_ `ktor-server-core` classes are specifically excluded from auto-reloading, so if you are working on something in ktor itself,
don't expect it to be reload automatically. It can't work because core classes are loaded before auto-reload machinery kicks in.
The exclusion can potentially be smaller, but it's hard to analyse all the transitive closure of types loaded during
startup.
