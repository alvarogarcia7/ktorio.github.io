Ktor is a framework to easily build connected applications – web applications, HTTP services, mobile and browser applications.
Modern connected applications need to be asynchronous to provide best experience to users, and Kotlin coroutines provide
awesome facilities to do it in an easy and straightforward way.

While not yet entirely there, Ktor goal is to provide end-to-end multiplatform application framework for connected applications.
Currently JVM client and server scenarios are supported, and we are working to bringing server facilities to native
environments, and client facilities to native and JavaScript facilities.

Ktor embraces strongly typed nature of Kotlin programming language and provides strongly typed end-points (Locations) and
ability to exchange data with classes shared across platforms.
