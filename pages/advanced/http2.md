[HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) is a modern binary duplex multiplexing protocol designed as a replacement for HTTP/1.x.

Jetty, Netty and Tomcat engines provide HTTP/2 implementations which Ktor can use. However there are significant differences
and every engine requires additional configuration. Once your host is configured properly ktor HTTP/2 support get activated automatically.

Key requirements:

* SSL certificate (could be self-signed)
* ALPN implementation suitable for particular engine (see corresponding sections for Netty, Jetty and Tomcat)
* HTTP/2 compliant browsers (all major browsers do support it since the end of 2015 according to [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=http2))

## SSL certificate

As per specification HTTP/2 does not require encryption, but all browsers will require encrypted connections to be used with HTTP/2.
That's why working TLS is a prerequisite for enabling HTTP/2.
A certificate is required to enable encryption. For testing purposes it can be generated with `keytool` from JDK.


```bash
keytool -keystore test.jks -genkeypair -alias testkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 5000 -dname 'CN=localhost, OU=ktor, O=ktor, L=Unspecified, ST=Unspecified, C=US'
```

The next step is configuring ktor to use your keystore. See example application.conf

```
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
        sslPort = 8443
        watch = [ ]
    }

    application {
        modules = [ com.example.ModuleKt.main ]
    }

    security {
        ssl {
            keyStore = /path/to/test.jks
            keyAlias = testkey
            keyStorePassword = changeit
            privateKeyPassword = changeit
        }
    }
}
```

## ALPN implementation

HTTP/2 requires ALPN ([Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation) )
to be enabled. Unfortunately JDK's TLS implementation doesn't have support for ALPN so your application engine should be configured properly.
The first option is to use external ALPN implementation that needs to be added to the boot classpath.
The other option is to use OpenSSL native bindings and precompiled native binaries. Both approaches are error-prone
and require extra attention when being configured. Also every particular engine could support only one of these methods.

### Jetty

Jetty supports ALPN extension for JDK so to get it working you have to add extra-dependency to java **boot classpath**.
It is very important to add it to **boot** classpath, as adding it to regular classpath doesn't work.
The other issue is that exact dependency version depends on JDK version. For example for JDK 8u144 alpn boot 8.1.11.v20170118
should be used (see https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/alpn-chapter.html#alpn-versions for full compatibility list).

The following JVM options should be applied (path can be relative):

```
-Xbootclasspath/p:/path/to/alpn-boot-8.1.11.v20170118.jar
```

Depending on your build system you will probably need to copy dependency to some specific directory.
In Maven you could use `maven-dependency-plugin` (goal `copy-dependencies`) or `Copy` task in Gradle.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>unpack-jetty-alpn</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>copy-dependencies</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <phase>compile</phase>
                    <configuration>
                        <includeArtifactIds>alpn-boot</includeArtifactIds>
                        <stripVersion>true</stripVersion>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

If all of the above is done properly Jetty will log that ssl, alpn and h2 are enabled:

```
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - jetty-9.4.6.v20170531
INFO  o.e.jetty.server.AbstractConnector - Started ServerConnector@337762cd{HTTP/1.1,[http/1.1, h2c]}{0.0.0.0:8080}
INFO  o.e.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory - x509=X509@433defed(testkey,h=[],w=[]) for SslContextFactory@2a693f59(null,null)
INFO  o.e.jetty.server.AbstractConnector - Started ServerConnector@49c90a9c{SSL,[ssl, alpn, h2, http/1.1]}{0.0.0.0:8443}
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @1619ms
```


### Netty

The easiest way to enable HTTP/2 in Netty is to use OpenSSL bindings ([tcnative netty port](http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html)).
Add an API jar to dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-tcnative</artifactId>
    <version>${tcnative.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

and then  native implementation (statically linked BoringSSL library, a fork of OpenSSL)

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
        <artifactId>netty-tcnative-boringssl-static</artifactId>
        <version>${tcnative.version}</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
        <artifactId>netty-tcnative-boringssl-static</artifactId>
        <version>${tcnative.version}</version>
        <classifier>${tc.native.classifier}</classifier>
    </dependency>
```

where `tc.native.classifier` should be one of the following: `linux-x86_64`, `osx-x86_64` or `windows-x86_64`.

Once all dependencies provided Ktor will enable HTTP/2 support on SSL port.

### Tomcat and other servlet containers

Similar to Netty, to get HTTP/2 working in Tomcat you need native openssl bindings. Unfortunately original
Tomcat's tcnative is not well compatible with Netty's one.
This is why you need slightly different binaries (you can get it here http://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/ or you can
try Netty's tcnative however you'll have to guess which exact version is compatible with your specific Tomcat version)

If you are deploying your ktor application as a war package into the server (servlet container) then you have to
configure your Tomcat server properly:

* <https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/http.html#HTTP/2_Support>
* <https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/http2.html>
* <https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/ssl-howto.html>
* <http://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/>
