You can develop your own features and reuse them across your Ktor applications, or share with the community. Typical
feature has the following structure:

```kotlin
class CustomFeature(configuration: Configuration) {
    val prop = configuration.prop // get snapshot of config into immutable property

    class Configuration {
        var prop = "value" // mutable property
    }

    // implement ApplicationFeature in a companion object
    companion object Feature : ApplicationFeature<ApplicationCallPipeline, CustomFeature.Configuration, CustomFeature> {
        // create unique key for the feature
        override val key = AttributeKey<CustomFeature>("CustomFeature")

        // implement installation script
        override fun install(pipeline: ApplicationCallPipeline, configure: Configuration.() -> Unit): CustomFeature {

            // run configuration script
            val configuration = CustomFeature.Configuration().apply(configure)

            // create a feature
            val feature = CustomFeature(configuration)

            // intercept a pipeline
            pipeline.intercept(â€¦) {
                // call a feature
            }
            return feature
        }
    }
}
```

`CustomFeature` is a feature instance class, which should be immutable to avoid unintended side-effects in a highly
concurrent environment. Feature implementation should be thread-safe as it will be called from multiple threads.

`Configuration` instance is handed to the user installation script and allows for feature configuration.

`Feature` companion object conforms to Ktor API and wires things together.

Feature can be installed with the standard `install` function:

```kotlin
fun Application.main() {
    install(CustomFeature) { // Install a custom feature
        prop = "Hello" // configuration script
    }
}
```
