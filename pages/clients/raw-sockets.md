Ktor support Client Raw Sockets that allows you to connect, for example,
to a telnet server, or to write custom CIO (Coroutine I/O) clients to
connect to databases or your own servers using binary or text protocols.

Since raw sockets, applies to both: clients and servers, 
the documentation is unified in the **[Raw Sockets](/servers/raw-sockets.html)** page
in the server section.
